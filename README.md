# pq-solver
A simple C program that solves the p and q to factor a quadratic trinomial of the form ax²+ bx + c  

# Installation
You can install pq-finder by compiling it with make or gcc. You can also install the binaries but those are possibly not working correctly.

# Usage
To use pq-solver, you must provide the a,b and c variable in the arguments.  
Here is an example with the trinomial 3x² + 4x - 4  
```  
$ ./pq-solver 3 4 -4  
a: 3  
b: 4  
c:-4  

p*q: 12
p+q: 4

p:  2  
q: -6  
```
